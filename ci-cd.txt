1. what is ci/cd ?

    A CI/CD or Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline implementation helps to automate steps in the software delivery process such as initiating code builds, running automated tests, and deploying to a staging or production environment.

    CI, short for continuous integration, is a software development practice in which all developers merge code changes in a central repository multiple times a day.

    CD stands for continuous delivery which, on top of continuous integration, adds the practice of automating the entire software release process.

    Continuous integration and continuous delivery require continuous testing because the objective is to deliver quality applications and code to users. Continuous testing is often implemented as a set of automated regression, performance, and other tests that are executed in the CI/CD pipeline.
